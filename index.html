      <p>If we could do it again, we wouldn't have done it any other way! After spending two years researching all the big production builders in the area, we came across an opportunity to build a home with Majestic Homes.</p>
      <p>We had never considered a small builder, but it became evident early in the design & build process with Majestic Homes that we had made the right choice.</p>
      <p>Working with Majestic Homes was truly a great experience from beginning to end. We got to work directly with the builder for a unique customized experience. He was very caring and professional and treated our home as if it was his. His team of professionals, including the real estate agent, the architect, his trades, and his suppliers were extremely helpful and thorough and made the process very seamless.</p>
      <p>We are very pleased with quality and attention put into our new home!</p>

      <p>Shannon and I have been in the house for a little over two weeks now and we just wanted to write to say that we couldn’t be happier. The first and best surprise was that we were actually in our new home for the holidays – I still can’t believe that you were able to complete the house on time and meet our tight closing date!</p>
      <p>On top of that, the house has been amazing – it has truly surpassed all of our hopes; the level of quality, detail and the overall craftsmanship is unbelievable.</p>
      <p>This truly has been a one of a kind custom home building experience and we can’t wait to spend many of the years ahead in our wonderful home.</p>
      <p>If we ever decide to build a new home again, it will definitely be with Majestic! – not just because of the beautiful home we have today, but because I now consider the owner a personal friend…</p>
      <p>Thank you for everything you have done to make this process and our new home so amazing!</p>

      <p>I wanted to say a big thank you on behalf of myself and Amy for installing our outside stove vent cover for us, as well as handling all the other (many) things we asked for since purchasing the house.

      <p>We are so glad we bought a Majestic home not just because of the quality of the work but also because of how well you have looked after us.  We could not have asked for better builder!</p>

      <p>The quality and craftsmanship of Majestic Homes was superb.  What made the building experience incomparable was the personal attention to detail from start to finish.  Our concerns were always given immediate attention, pricing was fair, and Raz went above and beyond to ensure we were happy.</p>
      <p>We would like to extend our thanks to Raz for all that he did to make our homebuilding experience a pleasurable one.  We absolutely love our new home!</p>
