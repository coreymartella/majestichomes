      <p>If we could do it again, we wouldn't have done it any other way! After spending two years researching all the big production builders in the area, we came across an opportunity to build a home with Majestic Homes.</p>
      <p>We had never considered a small builder, but it became evident early in the design & build process with Majestic Homes that we had made the right choice.</p>
      <p>Working with Majestic Homes was truly a great experience from beginning to end. We got to work directly with the builder for a unique customized experience. He was very caring and professional and treated our home as if it was his. His team of professionals, including the real estate agent, the architect, his trades, and his suppliers were extremely helpful and thorough and made the process very seamless.</p>
      <p>We are very pleased with quality and attention put into our new home!</p>

      <p>Shannon and I have been in the house for a little over two weeks now and we just wanted to write to say that we couldn’t be happier. The first and best surprise was that we were actually in our new home for the holidays – I still can’t believe that you were able to complete the house on time and meet our tight closing date!      </p>
      <p>On top of that, the house has been amazing – it has truly surpassed all of our hopes; the level of quality, detail and the overall craftsmanship is unbelievable.</p>
      <p>This truly has been a one of a kind custom home building experience and we can’t wait to spend many of the years ahead in our wonderful home.</p>
      <p>If we ever decide to build a new home again, it will definitely be with Majestic! – not just because of the beautiful home we have today, but because I now consider the owner a personal friend…</p>
      <p>Thank you for everything you have done to make this process and our new home so amazing!</p>

      <p>A while back we decided to build a new home. We have heard from many of our friends who bought or built a new home that this would be a stressful project, so we checked out quite a few builders, big and small.</p>
      <p>We decided to go ahead with Majestic Homes, and Raz was instrumental in reducing the stress factor to an absolute minimum. We ended up with a quality home at a very good price, given all the extras Raz had included in the standard features.</p>
      <p>Thank you Raz! We are already looking forward to our next Majestic home</p>
