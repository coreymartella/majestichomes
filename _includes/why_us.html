    When you build with Majestic Homes you are creating a long lasting partnership working directly with us to build your dream home. In relationships with other builders home owners feel there is a fence between themselves and the builder, at Majestic Homes there is no fence! We only build 6-7 homes a year and the builder/owner of the company, Raz, is personally involved with each build. You have his email address and cell phone number.

      <h3>Phase 1: Your Home, Your Design</h3>
      <p>Majestic Homes is a custom home builder, you work with a home designer to plan your dream home. Unlike other builders where you are limited to a small set of floor plans and elevations.</p>
      <p>
        Some clients bring a very clear idea of what they want, while others start with a blank piece of paper and describe how they live and a plan materializes. Others browse through other floor plans and pick favourite elements from them.
        <!-- The only constraints are the size of the building envelope for your lot and your budget. -->
      </p>
      <p>Once you have a completed plan a starting price is provided and your agreement is signed with Majestic Homes that includes the closing date for your home.</p>

<pre>
  We did sort through various emails that Dave sent to prospective buyers, and selected wording he used in describing the building process with Majestic – please see below. His wording is more focused on the first stage of the process – signing a contract with Majestic. This stage includes understanding the custom-build process, designing the layout, and obtaining a starting price. A point to make in supporting “what differentiates Majestic from other builders” is the idea of “partnership” between Razvan and the buyer, the collaboration during the build, buyers working with Razvan directly. This idea is stated in Majestic’s existing website. Somehow we need to convey a clear message that the builder and the buyers are not placed in opposite sides of “the fence”. There is no fence. They are on the same team.

  The second stage – process during construction – is not referred to in Dave’s messages. This section is touched on Majestic’s existing website (“Home” and “Business Values” page). We called it “flexibility”, and we must continue stating this idea as part of “what differentiates Majestic from other builders”.  We need to make a point of the wide variety of options available to buyers in choosing interior and exterior finishings. Perhaps this area is where we should focus on and provide more info to prospective buyers in the new website. This section should be an integral part of describing and helping clients understand the process of custom-building with Majestic.  We need to explain that this is the stage for designing interior items, such as kitchen and bathroom cabinetry, or placement of electrical outlets. This is the stage for selections for front entrance door, windows style and colour, stone, shingles, brick, fireplace type, furnace type, flooring, plumbing fixtures, baseboards, casings, interior door hardware, interior door style, paint, stain, etc. We also need to note that additional costs may be incurred during this stage based on the interior design and selections made if above Majestic’s standards (standards as detailed in the spec sheet, and also available when visiting Majestic’s suppliers). Making the point that any such additional costs are to be priced based on the buyers’ specific options. No pricing can be provided, until explicit selections are made. Custom building implies custom pricing, since it is based on buyers’ particular choices. Concluding that custom-building with Majestic also requires time commitment in the part of the buyers if they want to fully benefit of this unique offering. The more selections buyers want to make on their own, the more time is required. Timelines for selections are set and provided to buyers once the offer is firmed up. When selections are not made by the customers within the timelines set, Majestic will select by default on behalf of the buyers. Delaying selection of a particular item may affect subsequent steps, and in the end it may jeopardize meeting the closing date.

  The third and last stage of the process is the one starting when buyers take possession of their homes. The warranty period.

  Excerpts from Dave’s emails:

  We are offering a custom home building experience...so we don't have any plans that you have to use.  Our designer has some plans that may start you off with some ideas, or you can bring your own plans/ideas to the table.

  Our process is as follows:

  1)  $2,000 holds the lot you want and starts the design process.  This $2,000 is non-refundable.  It is not a deposit.  Whether you move forward or not, it goes to pay for the designer's time.
  2)  Once you have a plan, we price it out based on our standard plans and pricing
  3)  We price out any design upgrades separately
  4)  Once we've decided on a price and a plan, you make an offer in writing to the builder.  A $5,000 deposit is due with the offer.  This deposit is refundable if your conditions aren't met.
  5)  There will be 3 conditions in the offer lasting 15 days:
            a)  conditional on you getting financing
            b)  conditional on your lawyer's approval
            c)  conditional on the developer's approval of your plan
  6)  Once the offer firms up (all conditions are met), then a further $20,000 deposit is due.
  7)  Once the deal is firm, we set some deadlines for you to make your selections (kitchen cabinets, fixtures, door hardware, etc.).  If there are any upgrades during this phase, we do an amendment to the agreement and add them into the price.
  8)  60 days after the offer is firm, a further deposit of $25,000 is due.  The $50,000 is credited towards the purchase price on closing.


  We are a custom builder, so you design your own home with us (hence no plans on the website).  I do have virtual tours and photos of homes we have built in the past. Here is a link to my website with some information on what lots are available.


  We are a custom home builder, so our process is a little bit different than your standard production builder.  With us, you get to design your own home.  As a result, we don't have any "standard" floor plans for any of our lots.  You meet with our designer and he will draw your vision.  Some clients arrive to the designer with a very clear idea of what they want, others start with a blank piece of paper and describe how they live and a plan materializes.  The only constraints are the size of the building envelope for your lot and the budget.  We have a few options for ways you can get to know our process, standard specs, and what sets up apart:

  Option #1:  I can meet you at our model home for a private viewing.  During our visit you'll get a sense for the quality of a Majestic Homes build, I'll walk you through the process of building with Majestic (including discussing the builder himself), and I'll point out standard and upgraded features.

  Option #2:  here is a link to my website http://www.mres.ca/daveshomes/myweb.php?hls=10060  It should answer a lot of your preliminary questions.

  Option #3:  drive by some of our previous builds.  There is a list on my website with some virtual tours and photos as well as some of our most recent including Lot 103 and 104 on Eaglecrest.


  Comparing Fusion and Majestic Homes is like comparing apples to oranges.  We are a custom home builder...you design your own floor plan with us.  We only build 6-7 homes a year and the builder/owner of the company is personally involved with each build.  You have his email address and cell phone number.  I could list many differences, but please keep this in mind when you are comparing the two companies.  Please don't get me wrong, Fusion is an excellent builder, we are just 2 very different companies.


  River Ridge area is unique. As such, our project in River Ridge is unique in that we offer clients a custom design and build experience. Majestic Homes is not a typical production builder that has 10 plans and you choose one.

  If you're looking for a "non-standard" building experience, then our agent - David McIntyre - would love to connect with you and provide you further information.
